{"name":"Bits and Gits of EnCollab","tagline":"All the information and docs that you will need to set up and run for the Encollab","body":"### Tools and Equipments\r\n1. #### Processor :computer:\r\nPreferably preferably (Core i5 3rd Generation or higher)\r\n\r\n2. #### Screens :tv:\r\nIt is best to have a secondary screen to split your work in different view and also to check how your creation will look on different screen resolution. Especially if you are using a notebook to do the development work, the second monitor is strongly recommended. Alternatively, you can also check how the page will look on different screen via <http://quirktools.com/screenfly/>. \r\n\r\n3. #### Text Editors :memo:\r\nIf you have preferred choice of text editor, use it. Otherwise, [Sublime](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/perfect-workflow-in-sublime-text-free-course--net-27293) is recommended.\r\n\r\n### Communication :calling:\r\nTeam EnCollab uses the application called __#Slack__ to communicate among developers. Different channels are created to discuss different topics or projects that we are working on. __Skype__ is the preferred form of calling if you want to talk to another team member. Clear communication is imperative. Clear your doubt with your team members before you start working in order to not waste your time and effort.\r\n\r\n#### Communication Tools\r\n * __#Slack__ can be access in __three__ ways\r\n    1. Browser\r\n    2. Desktop Apps\r\n       * Mac\r\n       * Windows\r\n       * Linux\r\n    3. Mobile Apps\r\n       * iOS\r\n       * Android\r\n       * Windows Phone\r\n * __Good things about _#Slack_ is:__\r\n  * when you are added to the Channel (i.e. Chat group), you can see the history of the conversation when the channel was first started. :+1:\r\n  * When you enabled the push notification on your mobile device, it automatically disabled the e-mail notification. :+1:\r\n\r\n### Source Codes Control (Git on GitHub) :floppy_disk:\r\nEncollab uses Git for source codes version control. Therefore, one needs to be familiar with the git commands. If you have used any command-line interface like __Cygwin__, it is a similar kind. To get access to the EnCollab's repositories on GitHub, follow the steps below.\r\n\r\n1. Open the account on <https://github.com/>\r\n2. Acquire access to __Encollab__ Repositories from _**Graham R**_(@grahamrobbo).\r\n3. For a start [Download](https://desktop.github.com/) the GitHub Desktop version for easier access.\r\n4. The entire [__Pro Git Book__](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is available online if we need to check how git works.\r\n5.
